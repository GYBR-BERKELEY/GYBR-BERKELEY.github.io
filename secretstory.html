			<p>"Remember why you're here", a <span id="words"><strong>voice</strong></span> whispered. Within its old wooden frame, Dark strands intertwined with secrets deep trapped the past in its place... while dust danced and  swirled and shifted in the glass. I sat in my gray chair, laying still with my <span id="words"><strong>watching, watching, watching</strong></span> eyes. I <span id="words"><strong>laughed</strong></span>. What a <span id="words"><strong>strange</strong></span> person I am, hearing such <span id="words"><strong>strange</strong></span> things in a familiar place. Normal. <span id="words"><strong>Very Normal.</strong></span> I like to imagine things sometimes; it goes with being me. I like moving my feet in between and around the legs of my gray chair, Comfortable. Rolling in <span id="words"><strong>circles, circles, circles.</strong></span>I stopped. <span id="words"><strong>I come from a land of green giants, I thought. I lived in an orange castle at the top of  a Villa, and I  have golden blood running through my veins because that is who I am  and  I am here and everything I have is a result of  what  I was</strong></span> including this <span id="words"><strong>stupid</strong></span> gray chair and  the existence of that wonderful <span id="words"><strong>dead dream</strong></span> staring back at me. <span id="words"><strong>Mocking Me</strong></span> at the front of my desk. It made me sad. <span id="words"><strong>And the voice didn't stop.</strong></p></span>
			<p>It called to me...<span id="words"><strong>softly. Weeping. Yearning. Warning.</strong></span>I looked into the <span id="words"><strong>ghost</strong></span> of a time long forgotten, buried. Treasure. <span id="words"><strong>I could see the thick fibers of the frame move. Wooden edges and  crevices  opening and closing. As if it was breathing.</strong></span> Inside, a child stared back at me, a strange, unrecognizable child. <span id="words"><strong>Happy.</strong></span> Whose young eyes filled with innocence and light. <span id="words"><strong>Broken.</strong></span> A man looking only at this child, entranced, holding her small body with one arm, Pride and Adoration reflected in his smile. A pure, grand smile...genuine. His eyes were loving eyes, crinkled, almost tightly shut, as if  her radiance  was too powerful for a father so poor and humble to behold.<span id="words"><strong>Damaged, Weakened.</strong></span> It is as if the child knew what  horror lay deep inside of her...sleeping. <span id="words"><strong>Waking.</strong></span> What tragic power, what  loss, what life.<span id="words"><strong>Destiny.</strong></span> Bronze Giant, what might and splendor you possessed!  No praise, no love, no ill word spoken that you have not received, as the ground  shook and  flowers bloomed  within your glorious path. Hair black and coarse, gentle, gentle. Now, <span id="words"><strong>Nothing.</strong></span> Now, <span id="words"><strong>No  One.</strong></span> But I. <span id="words"><strong>I remember. I will always remember. Or was it the child who now remembers? A child. Once light made flesh, a living proof of God's Great Promise, a visage into That Golden Paradise, now turned hellish. Monstrous. Did She Know? Did she always know what she would Become? Her eyes looked at me. And I hers. "Remember" she whispered in silence. And we both knew. We saw only the Villa of the Sun, and  the orange castle and the green giants, the Golden Family...and a Heart Forever Lost within the twinkle of her eye.</strong></span></p>
